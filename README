This is a program that computes a source region impact factor using the outputs of the Hybrid Single Particle 
Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (http://ready.arl.noaa.gov/hypub-bin/trajtype.pl?runtype=archive). Trajpy v. 2.0 was 
created as a result of an undergraduate thesis done at Reed College by Jonathan Tamsut under the advisement of Christopher Walsh.
